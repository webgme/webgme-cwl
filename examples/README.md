# webgme-cwl Examples
## Introduction
This folder is going to be a collection of example workflows that will allow new users to learn the tricks of 
visually modeling CWL workflows with our design studio. Some examples are also going to be featured in the
[standalone documentation](https://webgme-cwl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Each example will have its own sub-folder and will be listed in the next section with a short description
as the detailed description will be placed inside the sub-folder so that the examples could be used in a
standalone manner.

## List
#### GraphML workflow by [Anwar](https://github.com/Anwar-Said)
The goal of this workflow is to automate a graph machine learning process which predicts the probability of a given compoundâ€™s toxicity provided in the form of a graph. This problem setting falls under the well-known task of graph classification. You can find the compete description [here](https://webgme-cwl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Examples/examples.html#building-a-graph-classification-workflow-example).
