The examples collection of the CWL Design Studio
========================================

The goal
________

The goal of this collection is to provide additional
examples that new users can leverage for the early
learning of the features and how-to's of this
visual modeling environment. In contrary to the 
tutorials and how-to descriptions, these examples
will not focus on the process of the model creation,
rather they will focus on different (real-life) 
scenarios where the use of CWL models gives a boost
to productivity.
