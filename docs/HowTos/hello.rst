The Hello World of the CWL Design Studio
========================================

The goal
________

The aim of this hello world example is as all
such examples is to introduce a comprehensive yet 
easy to build example for the user exemplifying the 
main use-case of the whole design studio.

This is an end-to-end example in the sense that it starts
shortly describing how the dockerization of scripts should go 
and ending with noting the execution of a composed workflow 
using the standrard implementation of the CWL framework 
`cwltool <https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool>`_ 
. All necessary files can be found in our
`repository <https://github.com/webgme/webgme-cwl/tree/master/tutorials/hello >`_ .
